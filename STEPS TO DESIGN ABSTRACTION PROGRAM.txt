STEPS TO DESIGN ABSTRACTION PROGRAM
1. Create an interface.
2. Create a method inside interface.
3. Create an implementation class.
4. Implement the method of interface.
5. Create a Helper class.
6. Create a Helper method.
7. Helper method will create an object of implementation class, Up-cast the object to interface, return the object.


STEPS TO USE ABSTRACTION PROGRAM
1. Know the interface.
2. Know the methods of interface.
3. It is unnecessary to know the implementation class.
4. It is unnecessary to know “How method is implemented?”.
5. Know the Helper class.
6. Know the Helper method is it static or Non-static.
